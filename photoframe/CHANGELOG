Version 2.0:
    
* Use alternating MovieClips and swapDepths to avoid loading and
  rendering delays.
* Better randomization: images Array is randomized to insure each image
  gets seen in equal likelyhood.
* Reload images.xml after all images have been shown.
* Tapping screen skips to next image.
* Support for debugging.
* Attempt at using <images random="no">... to turn of randomization.
